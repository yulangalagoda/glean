# ADR-0001 — Normalised Entity Schema (v1, infra/domain scope)

- **Status:** Accepted (v0.1.0 frozen 2026-07-22, validated against a real pilot target, see `docs/PILOT_findings.md`; wildcard entity representation resolved 2026-07-23, see D3/D4)
- **Date:** 2026-07-22
- **Scope:** Glean v1, infrastructure / domain reconnaissance only
- **Machine-checkable schema:** [`docs/schema/entity-graph.schema.json`](../schema/entity-graph.schema.json)
- **Worked example:** [`docs/schema/example-scan.json`](../schema/example-scan.json) (validates against the schema)
- **Supersedes / feeds:** ADR-0002 (adapter contract), ADR-0003 (correlation/dedup), ADR-0004 (prioritisation), ADR-0005 (report shape) all depend on this.

## Context

Every tool Glean unions produces a different shape of output. The entire project rests on collapsing those shapes into one normalised, deduplicated, provenance-tracked model — the "entity graph" — that the deterministic correlation, the deterministic prioritisation, the LLM synthesis, and the evaluation harness all read from. This model is the keystone: if it is wrong, every adapter and the whole evaluation must be reworked. It therefore has to be frozen before any code that produces or consumes it is written.

Three requirements from the charter are binding on this schema:

1. **Provenance is a first-class field**, retained end-to-end, so every surfaced claim is traceable to its source tool. The provenance-retention metric is computed directly off this schema, so provenance cannot be an afterthought or a free-text note.
2. **Correlation/dedup is deterministic and done in code, not the LLM.** The schema must give the dedup code a stable identity to match on.
3. **Passive vs active collection is separated.** The schema must record, per assertion, how the data was obtained.

## Decision

Glean produces a single **Entity Graph** document per scan: a container of deduplicated `entities` plus directed `edges` between them, wrapped in `scan` metadata. The full structure is defined normatively in the JSON Schema; this ADR records the decisions and rules behind it.

### D1 — One record per real-world entity, with an array of provenance entries

When two tools report the same subdomain, Glean stores **one entity** carrying **two provenance entries**, not two linked records. Rationale: it makes deduplication the natural state of the graph rather than a post-hoc cleanup; it makes the provenance-retention metric fall out almost for free (walk each entity's `provenance` array); and it matches how an analyst thinks ("this host, seen by these sources"). The cost — a slightly richer entity model — is paid once, here.

The invariant: **every entity has at least one provenance entry.** An entity with no source cannot exist in a Glean graph (enforced by `minItems: 1` in the schema). This is the structural guarantee behind "0 fabricated findings."

### D2 — Stable deterministic identity key

Every entity has an `id` of the form `<type>:<canonical_value>` (e.g. `subdomain:admin.example.com`). Two tools reporting the same real-world entity **must** produce the same `id` after canonicalisation. Deduplication is therefore an identity match on `id`, not a fuzzy or LLM-driven merge — satisfying the "deterministic correlation" requirement. The detailed matching/merge behaviour lives in ADR-0003, but it is only possible because identity is defined here.

### D3 — Canonicalisation rules (what makes the `value`)

The `id` and `value` are only stable if canonicalisation is fixed. For v1:

- **Domains / subdomains:** lowercase; strip a trailing dot; IDNA/punycode-normalise internationalised names; no scheme, no port, no path.
- **Wildcards:** a literal `*.example.com` — seen as a certificate SAN or as a DNS record owner name — canonicalises to its own `subdomain` entity (`subdomain:*.example.com`), not a special type. **Resolved 2026-07-23** (previously an open question, D4 below has the full rule): the leading `*.` is kept verbatim in `value`/`id` rather than stripped, because it is not the same fact as the bare apex — a wildcard is a distinct, structurally real thing that was observed (a pattern-match capability), and collapsing it into the apex entity would lose that.
- **IP addresses:** validated; IPv6 compressed to its canonical short form; no zone suffix.
- **Email addresses:** lowercase the whole address (v1 treats the local part case-insensitively for dedup — recorded as a known simplification).
- **DNS records:** canonicalise the owning name as a host; record type uppercased (`A`, `MX`, `TXT`, …).
- **Services:** `<ip>:<port>` with port as an integer attribute; protocol lowercased.
- **Certificates:** identity keyed on the certificate fingerprint (SHA-256) when available, else on the serial + issuer. **Validated against a real crt.sh pull (pilot, 604 rows): the crt.sh JSON API never returns a fingerprint field, only `issuer_name` + `serial_number`.** For any adapter built against crt.sh's summary JSON endpoint, serial+issuer is not a fallback — it is the only available identity. Wording changed from "fallback" to reflect this.

Canonicalisation happens in the adapter/normalisation layer, never in the LLM.

### D4 — Open per-type `attributes`, closed top-level shape

The top-level entity object is `additionalProperties: false` (a stable, validated envelope), but `attributes` is an open object so each entity type can carry its own detail without a schema version bump. The per-type attribute conventions for v1:

| Type | Typical attributes |
|------|--------------------|
| `domain` | registrar, creation/expiry dates |
| `subdomain` | (mostly relationships); `wildcard` (bool, set when D3's wildcard rule applies); `wildcard_confirmed_active` (bool, see note below) |
| `ip_address` | asn, network/CIDR, geo (coarse), ptr |
| `dns_record` | record_type, ttl, rdata |
| `email_address` | (source context only) |
| `breach_exposure` | breach_name, breach_date, data_classes |
| `service` | port (int), protocol, service name, banner_ref |
| `web_tech` | product, version, category |
| `certificate` | fingerprint_sha256, issuer, subject, not_before, not_after, san[] |

Adding a **new entity type** to the enum is a schema version bump; adding a new *attribute* is not.

**Wildcard entities are not literally resolvable, and evidence of one is not evidence it is still active (resolved 2026-07-23).** `*.example.com` is a pattern-match capability, not an addressable host — no adapter or downstream signal may treat a literal DNS lookup of the string `*.example.com` as meaningful (some resolvers will even answer it due to wildcard matching, which makes this an explicit rule, not a safe assumption). The only way to confirm a wildcard is *currently* active is to resolve an arbitrary, non-predefined probe subdomain and see whether it answers — a structurally different check from resolving a literal name. `wildcard_confirmed_active` is set only by positive evidence from that kind of probe; it is absent (not `false`) when no such probe ran, matching the same "absence of a check is not evidence" discipline ADR-0004's `stale_no_dns` already established. This distinction matters because certificate evidence of a wildcard SAN is permanent (once logged, it never leaves CT logs) while the underlying DNS wildcard record is not — the two can and do diverge in practice, confirmed directly against real infrastructure this session, where a wildcard certificate remained visible in CT logs after the corresponding DNS wildcard record had been deliberately removed.

### D5 — Relationships as first-class edges

Relationships (`subdomain_of`, `resolves_to`, `hosts`, `has_record`, `exposes_service`, `runs_tech`, `issued_for`, `exposed_in_breach`) are stored as directed `edges` referencing entity `id`s, not embedded inside entities. Rationale: keeps entity records clean, makes the graph explicit for the eventual GUI on the roadmap, and lets an edge carry its own provenance (which tool asserted the link). Referential integrity — every edge endpoint exists in `entities` — is a document invariant checked in code (JSON Schema can't express it; the validation harness does).

### D6 — Provenance entry shape

Each provenance entry records `source_tool`, optional `source_module`, `method` (`passive`|`active`), `collected_at`, an optional `raw_record_ref` pointing into the archived raw tool output, and an optional `confidence`. The `raw_record_ref` is what makes a surfaced claim traceable all the way to source bytes — the strongest form of the provenance guarantee, and reproducibility insurance.

### D7 — Deterministic priority lives on the entity, LLM never writes it

The optional `priority` object (`score`, `rank`, `signals`) is populated by the ADR-0004 scoring code. The LLM reads it to write narrative; it never sets it. This is the structural expression of the charter's "deterministic score + LLM narrative" split, and it is what lets the evaluation test whether the LLM's narrative is faithful to a ranking it did not invent.

### D8 — Scan metadata and the passive/active ledger

The `scan` block records the target, an `authorisation` note (the basis on which the target was cleared to scan — binding per charter), timing, Glean version, and a `tools_run` ledger giving each tool's version, method, and a pointer to its archived raw output. This block is the reproducibility and audit header for the whole document.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** dedup and provenance-retention become near-trivial to compute; the passive/active separation is machine-enforced; the schema is versioned and machine-validated from day one; adapters have a single, testable target; the deterministic/LLM boundary is structural, not a matter of discipline.
- **Costs / accepted simplifications:** the merged-entity model is slightly more complex to write in adapters; email case-folding may over-merge in rare cases (recorded); `attributes` being open means per-type validation is convention + code, not pure schema. These are deliberate v1 trade-offs.
- **What this locks:** ADR-0002 through ADR-0005 must conform to this. Any change to entity types, the id convention, or the provenance shape is a `schema_version` bump and a new ADR.

## Open questions (status after pilot)

1. Entity-type enum completeness — confirmed sufficient for crt.sh and theHarvester output; Amass/BBOT/dnsx not yet pilot-tested.
2. ~~Confirm `certificate` identity on fingerprint is available from crt.sh output in practice.~~ **Resolved: no, it is not available. Serial+issuer is the primary identity path for crt.sh, not a fallback.** See D3.
3. Decide whether `breach_exposure` stays in v1 — still open, not exercised by this pilot (no breach source was queried).
4. ~~How is `*.example.com` represented — its own entity, or just a SAN annotation on the certificate?~~ **Resolved 2026-07-23:** its own `subdomain` entity, `wildcard` attribute set true, `id`/`value` keep the literal `*.` prefix rather than collapsing into the apex. See D3/D4.

## Validation

Validated 2026-07-22 against real crt.sh output (604 rows / 207 unique hostnames) for a domain the operator owns. Ten sample records — including a wildcard, a multi-name certificate, and a plain subdomain — all mapped cleanly onto `subdomain`/`domain`/`certificate` types with no schema gaps. Canonicalisation rules for mixed case, trailing dots, and punycode were not exercised by this dataset (no such records appeared) — they remain unvalidated, not confirmed. Full findings: `docs/PILOT_findings.md`.
